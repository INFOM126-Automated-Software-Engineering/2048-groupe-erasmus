## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead:
- Open a **private GitHub Security Advisory**, or
- Contact the maintainers via GitHub discussions if private reporting is not available

Please include:
- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- A proof of concept if possible

We will respond as quickly as possible.

## Reporting Bugs
For non-security related bugs, please open a GitHub issue and use the **Bug Report** [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
